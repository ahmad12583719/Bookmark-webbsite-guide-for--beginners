HTML File: index.html Explained
-----------------------------
1. What is HTML?
   - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the basic language for creating web pages.
   - HTML uses tags (like <h1>, <ul>, <li>, etc.) to structure content.

2. File Structure
   - <!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
   - <html lang="en">: The root element of the page. "lang='en'" means the page is in English.
   - <head>: Contains information about the page (not shown on the page itself).
     - <meta charset="UTF-8">: Sets the character encoding (for special characters).
     - <meta name="viewport" ...>: Makes the site look good on phones and tablets.
     - <title>: The name of the page (shown in the browser tab).
     - <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">: Connects the CSS file for styling.
   - <body>: All the visible content goes here.

3. Main Heading
   - <h1 class="main-title">My Bookmarks</h1>
     - <h1>: Biggest heading, used for the page title.

     - <img src="..." alt="..." class="site-logo">: Shows the website's logo next to the name.
     - The name of the website (like Gmail, YouTube, etc.)

-----------------------------
- Always save your files after editing and refresh your browser to see changes.

- Use comments (/* ... */ in CSS, <!-- ... --> in HTML) to explain your code.
- Start simple, then add more features as you learn.
- If something breaks, check for missing < > or { } or ;
- Practice by changing colors, adding bookmarks, or swapping images.
- Ask for help or search online if you get stuckâ€”everyone starts as a beginner!

Happy coding!
